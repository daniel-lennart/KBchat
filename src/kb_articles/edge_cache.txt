1. Introduction
This guide provides a detailed walk-through on how to clear cache and browsing data in Microsoft Edge, a fundamental troubleshooting step to resolve common browsing issues, like loading or formatting problems on websites.

2. Process Steps
2.1 Open Microsoft Edge
Click on the Microsoft Edge icon on your desktop or taskbar to launch the browser.
2.2 Accessing Settings
Locate and click on the three horizontal dots (or ellipsis) at the top-right corner of the browser window.
In the dropdown menu, select "Settings."
2.3 Navigate to Privacy and Services
On the left-hand side of the "Settings" window, click on "Privacy, search, and services."
2.4 Clear Browsing Data
Under the "Clear browsing data" section, click on "Choose what to clear."
In the "Time range" dropdown menu, select the desired time range for which you want to clear the browsing data. Options typically include:
Last hour
Last 24 hours
Last 7 days
Last 4 weeks
All time (to clear all cached data)
Ensure that the checkbox next to "Cached images and files" is selected.
Optionally, you may select additional items to clear, such as "Cookies and other site data," "Browsing history," etc.
Click on the "Clear now" button.
2.5 Completion and Verification
Once the cached data is cleared, close and reopen Microsoft Edge.
Visit the previously problematic website to verify if the issue persists.
3. Additional Tips
Regularly clearing cache can prevent website loading issues and ensure you’re viewing the most recent version of websites.
Remember that clearing cookies and site data will sign you out of websites and might remove saved settings for specific sites.
If website issues persist even after clearing the cache, try using Edge in "InPrivate" mode, as this mode doesn’t store cache, cookies, or browsing history.
